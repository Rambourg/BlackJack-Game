# BlackJack-Game
The players and the dealer are each dealt two cards. The dealer's cards are face down, while the player's cards are face up. The players then have the option of “hitting”, which means asking for another card, or “staying”, which means keeping the cards they have. If a player's total exceeds 21, he or she has “busted” and automatically loses. 


Once all players have hit or stayed, it is then the dealer's turn. The dealer must follow a certain set of rules based on the cards he or she has. The dealer must hit if the total is less than 17, and must stay if the total is 17 or higher. If the dealer busts, all players who are still in the game win. 


If neither player busts and the dealer has a lower total than the player, the player wins. If the dealer has a higher total than the player, the dealer wins. If both the dealer and the player have the same total, it is considered a tie or “push” and no one wins. 


Blackjack is an exciting and popular game, and you can find it in many casinos, online or off. It is important to remember the rules of the game and to always strive to make the best decisions possible in order to maximize your chances of winning
